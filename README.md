## Summary

This GitHub repository, [access-page-variable](https://github.com/andreacassani/access-page-variable), provides a practical guide on accessing web page variables from a Chrome extension. Chrome extensions operate separately from web pages, making it challenging to interact with web page variables directly.

The guide demonstrates how to bridge this gap using a `<script>` injection method. It offers step-by-step instructions, code examples, and explanations to configure your Chrome extension, inject a script into a target web page, and access web page variables.

For in-depth details, refer to the full blog post: [Access a web page variable from a Chrome Extension](https://andreacassani.com/blog/access-page-variable-chrome-extension).
